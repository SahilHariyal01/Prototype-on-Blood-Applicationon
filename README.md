The traditional blood management system in our blood banks looks very outdated considering their blood and blood plasma wastage records. 
The blood which is collected in the blood banks is not delivered properly at proper time to the needy ones so it is being wasted. 
We came up with a system (leaded by an android mobile app) which will build an effective communication between blood banks and the people who are in need of blood. 
Our app helps hospitals and individuals to locate the blood of their required category. 
We also have implemented GPS in our app so that people wonâ€™t get trouble in finding the blood banks.
